# GA Repository
## Genetic algorithm test
The purpose of this repository is only to code my first genetic algorithm nothing crazy. It will try to resolve _NUMBER_ (+-*/) _NUMBER_ (+-*/) _NUMBER_ = 42 with a population of 100 chromosomes. It will also run 100 batchs and display all the results found.

## Next
- Make all inputs configurable with arg (number of _NUMBER_, target number...)
- add some tests
